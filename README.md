# The Greaaat Gatsby

These are the files of the [Greaaat](http://greaaat.com/) website, powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### I want to update my profile

That's fairly easy if you know how to use Git ! If not, there's no shame at all, just ask someone from Greaaat, we're here to help each other after all ðŸ˜Ž

* If you're not a member of the `adriantombu/the-greaaat-gatsby` project, ask me to add you ! You can also fork the repository if you want
* Create a new git branch to work on your modifications
* You can find the data of your profile in the `src/data/freelances` directory. As you can see, these are [Markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/) !
* When you're happy with your changes, just commit your changes, push your branch and start a new pull request
* Once your pull request has been approved and merged in the `master` branch, your modifications will be automagically deployed
